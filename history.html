            <small class="mt-4 d-block fs-6">
              Coffee has a long history, with its origins thought to be in Ethiopia, where the coffee plant was first discovered. According to legend, a goat herder named Kaldi noticed that his goats became especially lively and energetic after eating the berries of a particular plant. Kaldi tried the berries for himself and felt a similar surge of energy. The stimulating effects of the plant quickly spread throughout the region.
              <br><br>
              Originally, coffee was consumed as a food, with the berries mixed with animal fat to form energy-rich balls that could be carried on long journeys. The berries were later roasted and brewed into a drink that was thought to have medicinal properties.
              <br><br>
              In the 16th century, the Arab world saw the establishment of the first coffeehouses, which provided a
              space for people to socialize, share news, and engage in intellectual discussions. Coffeehouses quickly
              gained popularity throughout the Muslim world and into Europe, with the first coffeehouse opening in Venice in 1645.

              its humble origins in Ethiopia to its widespread global appeal.
